palindrome
==========


Problem
--------

Given a string s, determine whether s is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Examples of palindromes are: "a", "aba", "abba", and "racecar". Examples of strings that are not palindromes are: "abc", "ab", and "abcbz".


### Input Format:

Read your input from a file. The first line of the file contains N, the number of test cases. Following this are N lines, each with a string s.

### Output Format:

For each test case:
1) On the first line, print 'Case #n' (without quotes), where n is the case number (starting from 1).
2) On the second line, print 'yes' (without quotes), if s is a palindrome. Otherwise, print 'no' (without quotes).

### Bounds:

1 <= N <= 100
1 <= length of s <= 100
Each character in s will be a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
